## **Project Description:**  
HindsightAI is a web application that allows users to query their own video content for objects, actions, and situations that occur within it. In order to accomplish this task our application leverages the power of OpenAIâ€™s cutting-edge CLIP image classification model.  

### **The App**  
The application is composed of two main components, the graphic user interface (GUI) and the video processing pipeline. The GUI is powered by Streamlit - a python based web application development framework. The GUI allows users to upload, query, and interact with their video content. The video processing pipeline is powered by decord and handles the pre-processing of videos as well as their subsequent analysis.
